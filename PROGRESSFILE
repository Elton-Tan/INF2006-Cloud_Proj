ALWAYS READ THIS TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON:
This project is about cloud computing INF2006. REQUIRE NODE JS 21 using tailwind and react. 
Next steps:
1. Finish up the live alerts
2. Run Hadoop and Spark for sentiment analysis, word count and maybe even prediction (but perhaps we dont need to for prediction)
3. Agentic capabilities using Azure Cloud (we can really try this perhaps we can score better) [accomplish more than what lab has taught]
4. Complete report and API endpoints

NEED TO:
RESTART RDS
RECREATE NAT
RESTART EVENTBRIDGE
RESTART CLOUDFRONT

Dont authorise API first. Test on POSTMAN. Only authorise when OK to make it less troublesome
then npm start

npm start build, then host on S3. ONLY ACCEPT STATIC FILES because we are using S3!
