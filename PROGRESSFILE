This project is about cloud computing INF2006. REQUIRE NODE JS 21 using tailwind and react. Scraping using SELENIUM

Next steps:
1. To solve scrapper bot issue by creating dummy amazon account and set up IP rotation to prevent IP ban <- perhaps we should abandon this
2. See if we can use google keyword appearances + current lazada trending to forecast demand.
3. Focus to build infra for POC before proceeding on real implement [Next step: SET S3 to store snapshot]
4. Snapshot or reviews or both
5. Meta ad library to know whether competitor uploaded any ads and what kind

**DO NOT REMOVE**
(slow scrap to prevent IP ban)

to trigger no profile
as u are unlikely to identified as bot. <- i had to add this because i think im added to the suspicious list
