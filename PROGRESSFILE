This project is about cloud computing INF2006. REQUIRE NODE JS 21 using tailwind and react. Scraping using SELENIUM

Next steps:
1. To solve scrapper bot issue by creating dummy amazon account and set up IP rotation to prevent IP ban <- perhaps we should abandon this
2. Maybe we should skip amazon and go to lazada scrap. But current lazada scrape only manage to scrape 1 review. Progress nonetheless. Need to improve depth scraping <-I think it has something to do with boilerplate keywords. Keep? or edit
3. See if we can use google keyword appearances + current lazada trending to forecast demand.
4. Focus to build infra for POC before proceeding on real implement
